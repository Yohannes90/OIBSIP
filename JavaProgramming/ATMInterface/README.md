## Overview

- This project is an ATM interface done for Oasis infobite Java Programming intrenship. It provides basic functionality for managing bank accounts and performing transactions. The main goal of this project is to showcase my programming skills and knowledge in Java, OOP, and databases. You can access the demo [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yohannes-mekonnen-79bab0270_screen-recording-feb-28-2024-activity-7168556239348580352-jJB1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

## Features

- The ATM interface provides the following features:
    - User authentication: Implement a secure authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access their bank accounts.
    - Balance inquiry: Users can check the balance of their bank account.
    - Deposit: Users can deposit money into their bank account.
    - Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their bank account.
    - Transfer funds: Allow users to transfer money between their bank accounts or send money to other bank accounts.


## Near Future Add on's

- In the near future, I plan to add the following features to the ATM interface:
    - Account creation: Users can create a bank account by providing their personal information.
    - Transaction history: Users can view the transaction history of their bank account.
    - Currency conversion: Implement a feature to support currency conversion for international transactions.
    - ATM UI: Develop a graphical user interface for the ATM to enhance the user experience.
