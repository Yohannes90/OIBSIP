## Overview

- This project is an Number Guessing Game done for Oasis infobite Java Programming intrenship. It is a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number generated by the computer. The user will have multiple attempts to guess the correct number. The main goal of this project is to brush up and showcase my programming skills and knowledge in Java. You can access the demo [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yohannes-mekonnen-79bab0270_screen-recording-feb-28-2024-activity-7168567607615287296-4zAr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).


## Built With

- The personal portfolio website is built using
    - **Java**
    - **IntelliJ IDEA** as primary IDE,
    - **VScode** as IDE,
    - **git** and **github** for version control...

## File Structure

- File structure of the project is organized as follows:
    - resources/ - Contains db file
        - bank.db
    - src/ - Contains the source code files
        - NumberGuessingGame.java: Main Java file containing the code for the number guessing game.
    - README.md - Readme file for the project

## Features

- The number guessing game project includes the following features:

    - Randomly generates a number for the user to guess.
    - Allows the user to enter their guess.
    - Provides feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.
    - Tracks the number of attempts made by the user.
    - Notifies the user if they guessed the correct number.
    - Allows the user to play again after guessing the correct number.
    - Allows the user to change difficuly [easy, medium, hard].

## Near Future Add on's

- In the near future, I plan to add the following features to this number guessing game:
    - Implement a scoring system to keep track of the user's performance.
    - Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
